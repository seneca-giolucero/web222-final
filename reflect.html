                <!-- Question 1 -->
                <p class="reflect-text">
                    This assignment was a great test of different concepts learned in the last couple weeks of web222. Specifically, many of the challenges I encountered dealt with managing the HTML
                    form in the contact page, and validating user input. In order to create the correct script to properly manipulate the html components, I first had to understand how to use 'form' in HTML.
                    As a reference, I used bootstrap's documentation on their website, as well as w3schools.com, which helped me to understand the input types and correct labelling for each component
                    of the form. Next, I tried to understand the logic behind making a 'Order Number' box appear once the user clicked on 'Order Problem'. Eventually, I discovered that I could used keyword 'hidden' 
                    in the div of the order number box. By doing so, I was able to create a conditional statement that would detect if the user clicked on Order Problem (using addEventListener('click')).
                    If they did, the script would remove the attribute hidden from the Order Number and have it be displayed on screen.
                </p>
                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <p>
                    Debugging took a good amount my time in this project, especially when creating the form. My approach to debugging was to break down my problem in to smaller pieces so that I could 
                    test different solutions without having to disassemble my whole form code. For example, I was having trouble creating the list of city names, which was to be revealed when the user
                    clicks on the city box. For some reason, the word 'choose' kept appearing underneath the text box, and when I clicked the box, there would be a drop down list with no names. To 
                    identify the problem, I looked up different documentation for html forms, and compared my code with others. After going line by line, I realized that I was mixing up the input 
                    types and select types. I, then, switched city type to input and province one to select.
                </p>
                <!-- Question 3 -->
                <p>
                  My best advice for other web programmers when creating forms on their website is to break it down layer by layer, and try to understand what each part of the form does. This is because
                  when you see a code sample of a form made in html, there can be a lot going on, specifically with input types, and adding additional keywords to create different functions (i.e hidden and
                  invalid feedback). However, understanding forms is quite easy, and it takes some testing to finally understand. Having documentation to reference as I completed my form was essential because
                  it allowed me to compare my code, and find some of my bugs. Another practical tip is to write down your flow of thinking to understand the logic of the form, so that when you, perhaps, create 
                  a script to manipulate the form, it'll be easier to know what needs to be manipulated and how it can be done.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Overall, I learned how to use documenation to identify the problems in my code, and find possible solutions to my code. This was my main method to complete this assingment.
